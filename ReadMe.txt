README

sorted into 3 directories

Sequential: Sequential Contains the source code for the sequential algorithm. To execute open "main.cpp" in geany
compile code through geany and execute through geany. Prompted for n being the value of the n*n matrix.

Parallel: Parallel Contains the source code for the parallel version of the algorithm which contains the cilk spawn and sync calls. To execute open "main.cpp" in geany, compile code through geany and execute through geany. Prompted for n being the value of the n*n matrix.

Time_Results: Time Results split into 2 directories, sequential_results and parallel_results. Each directory contains 5 txt files representing the output of the 5 executions for the sequential and parallel algorithms respectively.
Finally it contains the also the txt file speedup_comparison, which is the comparison of the two algorithm runtimes.
